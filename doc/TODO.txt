- make pyawskit have a boolean option to decide weather it will add entries to
	~/.ssh/config or to ~/.ssh/config.d/99_dynamic.conf
	in that process also create the folders (~/.ssh or ~/.ssh/config.d) if needed.
- make pyawskit_create_template which creates the ~/.pyawskit/launch_config.json
	file which you can fill.
- make pyawskit_remove_ssh_config_entries.py which removes the entries
	that were automatically added to ~/.ssh/config.
- make pyawskit_create_filter.py which creates the ~/.aws/aws_filter file
	for you.
- make pyawskit_kill_machine.py
- make pyawskit_launch_machine be able to launch more than 1 machine
	I think it already does support this. try this out.
- make pyawskit_generate_ssh_config have a parameters that controls
	whether it adds the hosts in all regions (currently this
	is its behaviour) or just in the default region or maybe
	some list of regions (in ~/.pyawskit/region_groups.json).
- add the ability to specify the size of the root hard drive of the machines
	you are launching.
- add the ability to connect a new hard drive per each machine you are
	creating.
- add the ability to connect an existing hard drive to a machine you
	are creating (note: machine and not machines, since a hard
	drive can only be connected to one machine at a time).
- remove the scripts under scripts (from_mine.sh, prep_machine.sh) and
	move them to ~/.pyawskit and the creation of the machine
	automatically run them on creation.
