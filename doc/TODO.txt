- make pyawskit_create_template which creates the ~/.pyawskit/launch_config.json
	file which you can fill.
- make pyawskit_remove_ssh_config_entries.py which removes the entries
	that were automatically added to ~/.ssh/config.
- make pyawskit_create_filter.py which creates the ~/.aws/aws_filter file
	for you.
- make pyawskit_kill_machine.py
- make pyawskit_launch_machine be able to launch more than 1 machine
	I think it already does support this. try this out.
- make pyawskit_generate_ssh_config have a parameters that controls
	whether it adds the hosts in all regions (currently this
	is it's behaviour) or just in the default region or maybe
	some list of regions (in ~/.pyawskit/region_groups.json).
- add the ability to specify the size of the root hard drive of the machines
	you are launching.
- add the ability to connect a new hard drive per each machine you are
	creating.
- add the ability to connect an existing hard drive to a machine you
	are creating (note: machine and not machines, since a hard
	drive can only be connected to one machine at a time).
